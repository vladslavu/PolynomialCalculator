# PolynomialCalculator
_Simple calculator using polynomials: add, sub, mul, div, integration and differentiation._
## The main idea of this project:
 ### Functional Requirements
  - The calculator must let the user to insert the wanted polynomials;
  - The operation should only be chosen by the user;
  - The calculator must perform all the operations described in the previous brief description: Addition, Subtraction,  Multiplication, Division, Differentiation and Integration.

  ### Non-functional Requirements
  - The interface has to be intuitive, clear, easy to use and pleasant for the eyes;
  - In case of an error, a message needs to be shown (maybe the polynomials were not introduces correctly).
